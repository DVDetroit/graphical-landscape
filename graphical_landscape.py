    Use turtle graphics and Python to create a graphical landscape. 

    1) The bottom half of the screen should be green.

    2) The top half of the screen should be blue.

    3) Draw grey mountains in the background using triangles.  Create at least 3 mountains of varying sizes.

    4) Draw an orange truck with black tires in the foreground.

    5) Draw your initials in the bottom right corner using forward(), right(), left(), penup() and pendown().  Do not use the write command.

    6) Include these instructions as comments at the beginning of your program.  Also comment each section, i.e. draw mountain, draw truck, etc.

    Attach your .py file to Blackboard.  Make sure you attach your .py file and not the .pyproj file.  If you attach the wrong file you will get zero credit.

    Don't forget the instructions as comments as well as code comments or you will loose points.
